Hello my name is Braxton Griffin and I am in the process of learning C#. I will be documenting my progress right here, follow me on this journey.

First
I went through and got C# to print out "Hello world!" that task was a simple one however the prerequistes of a C# file is still a good bit confusing for me.

Second
I made a program that asked the user, "What is your name?" and upon recieving input it replied with, "Hello, [NAME]! Nice to meet you!"
This exercise helped me understand user input and call back that user input.

Third
The next thing that I worked on was a simple console calculator where the calculator asks for the first and second numbers in the problem then asks you for the operator you wish to apply to those numbers. It then returns a solution, I changed it part way through development to not only use +, -, *, and / but to also work off of "add", "addition, "subtract", "subtraction", "divide", "division", "multiply", and "multiplication".

Fourth
I worked on a Number Guesser Game where the program picks a random number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess it. If the number is too low it prints, "Too low!" and vice versa for too high. Until you guess the correct number. This one was a bit of a doozy, I struggled with the "while" loop and "if" statement interaction. I encounterd many bugs and straight up crashes but eventually I got it working with the help of some classmates.

Fifth
I am about to start working on GUIs through Visual Studio, I'll update this as I go..
